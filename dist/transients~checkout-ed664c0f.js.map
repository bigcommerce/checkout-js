It\n   * might be for example a function that you passed to Observable's constructor, but most of the time it is\n   * a library implementation, which defines what will be emitted by an Observable, and when it be will emitted. This means\n   * that calling `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n   * the thought.\n   *\n   * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n   * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n   * of the following ways.\n   *\n   * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n   * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n   * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n   * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n   * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n   * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, if the `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n   * be left uncaught.\n   *\n   * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n   * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where the first function is equivalent\n   * of a `next` method, the second of an `error` method and the third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n   * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n   * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n   * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n   *\n   * Whichever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n   * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop the work that an Observable does and will clean\n   * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n   * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n   *\n   * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n   * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n   * by default emits all its values synchronously.

If passing the same Observable to `concat` 1000 times becomes tedious,\n * you can always use {@link repeat}.\n *\n * ## Examples\n * ### Concatenate a timer counting from 0 to 3 with a synchronous sequence from 1 to 10\n * ```ts\n * import { concat, interval, range } from 'rxjs';\n * import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const timer = interval(1000).pipe(take(4));\n * const sequence = range(1, 10);\n * const result = concat(timer, sequence);\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // results in:\n * // 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> 2 -1000ms-> 3 -immediate-> 1 ... 10\n * ```\n *\n * ### Concatenate 3 Observables\n * ```ts\n * import { concat, interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const timer1 = interval(1000).pipe(take(10));\n * const timer2 = interval(2000).pipe(take(6));\n * const timer3 = interval(500).pipe(take(10));\n *\n * const result = concat(timer1, timer2, timer3);\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // results in the following:\n * // (Prints to console sequentially)\n * // -1000ms-> 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> ... 9\n * // -2000ms-> 0 -2000ms-> 1 -2000ms-> ... 5\n * // -500ms-> 0 -500ms-> 1 -500ms-> ... 9\n * ```\n *\n * ### Concatenate the same Observable to repeat it\n * ```ts\n * import { concat, interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const timer = interval(1000).pipe(take(2));\n *\n * concat(timer, timer) // concatenating the same Observable!\n * .subscribe(\n *   value => console.log(value),\n *   err => {},\n *   () => console.log('...and it is done!')\n * );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 0 after 1s\n * // 1 after 2s\n * // 0 after 3s\n * // 1 after 4s\n * // \"...and it is done!\" also after 4s\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link concatAll}\n * @see {@link concatMap}\n * @see {@link concatMapTo}\n * @see {@link startWith}\n * @see {@link endWith}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} input1 An input Observable to concatenate with others.\n * @param {ObservableInput} input2 An input Observable to concatenate with others.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as argument.\n * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler=null] An optional {@link SchedulerLike} to schedule each\n * Observable subscription on.\n * @return {Observable} All values of each passed Observable merged into a\n * single Observable, in order, in serial fashion.\n * @static true\n * @name concat\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function concat<O extends ObservableInput<any>, R>(...observables: Array<O | SchedulerLike>): Observable<ObservedValueOf<O> | R> {\n  return concatAll<R>()(of(...observables));\n}\n","import { Observable } from '../Observable';\nimport { Operator } from '../Operator';\nimport { Subscriber } from '../Subscriber';\nimport { Subscription } from '../Subscription';\nimport { subscribeToResult } from '../util/subscribeToResult';\nimport { OuterSubscriber } from '../OuterSubscriber';\nimport { InnerSubscriber } from '../InnerSubscriber';\nimport { ObservableInput, OperatorFunction, ObservedValueOf } from '../types';\nimport { map } from './map';\nimport { from } from '../observable/from';\n\n/* tslint:disable:max-line-length */\nexport function mergeMap<T, O extends ObservableInput<any>>(project: (value: T, index: number) => O, concurrent?: number): OperatorFunction<T, ObservedValueOf<O>>;\n/** @deprecated resultSelector no longer supported, use inner map instead */\nexport function mergeMap<T, O extends ObservableInput<any>>(project: (value: T, index: number) => O, resultSelector: undefined, concurrent?: number): OperatorFunction<T, ObservedValueOf<O>>;\n/** @deprecated resultSelector no longer supported, use inner map instead */\nexport function mergeMap<T, R, O extends ObservableInput<any>>(project: (value: T, index: number) => O, resultSelector: (outerValue: T, innerValue: ObservedValueOf<O>, outerIndex: number, innerIndex: number) => R, concurrent?: number): OperatorFunction<T, R>;\n/* tslint:enable:max-line-length */\n\n/**\n * Projects each source value to an Observable which is merged in the output\n * Observable.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Maps each value to an Observable, then flattens all of\n * these inner Observables using {@link mergeAll}.</span>\n *\n * ![](mergeMap.png)\n *\n * Returns an Observable that emits items based on applying a function that you\n * supply to each item emitted by the source Observable, where that function\n * returns an Observable, and then merging those resulting Observables and\n * emitting the results of this merger.\n *\n * ##

Combines multiple Observables to create an Observable whose values are\n * calculated from the latest values of each of its input Observables.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Whenever any input Observable emits a value, it\n * computes a formula using the latest values from all the inputs, then emits\n * the output of that formula.</span>\n *\n * ![](combineLatest.png)\n *\n * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as\n * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all these values but the last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, if some Observable does not emit a value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array.

In particular, if some task was also scheduled with `asap` before,\n * that task will execute first. That being said, if you need to schedule task asynchronously, but\n * as soon as possible, `asap` scheduler is your best bet.\n *\n * ## Example\n * Compare async and asap scheduler<\n * ```ts\n * import { asapScheduler, asyncScheduler } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * asyncScheduler.schedule(() => console.log('async')); // scheduling 'async' first...\n * asapScheduler.schedule(() => console.log('asap'));\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // \"asap\"\n * // \"async\"\n * // ... but 'asap' goes first!\n * ```\n */\nexport const asapScheduler = new AsapScheduler(AsapAction);\n\n/**\n * @deprecated renamed.

It still is used to schedule timeout checks and -\n * as a consequence - when second Observable will be subscribed, since subscription happens\n * immediately after failing check.\n *\n * ## Example\n * Add fallback observable\n * ```ts\n * import { intrerval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { timeoutWith } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const seconds = interval(1000);\n * const minutes = interval(60 * 1000);\n *\n * seconds.pipe(timeoutWith(900, minutes))\n *   .subscribe(\n *     value => console.log(value), // After 900ms, will start emitting `minutes`,\n *                                  // since first value of `seconds` will not arrive fast enough.\n *     err => console.log(err),     // Would be called after 900ms in case of `timeout`,\n *                                  // but here will never be called.\n *   );\n * ```\n *\n * @param {number|Date} due Number specifying period within which Observable must emit values\n *                          or Date specifying before when Observable should complete\n * @param {Observable<T>} withObservable Observable which will be subscribed if source fails timeout check.\n * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler] Scheduler controlling when timeout checks occur.\n * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that mirrors behaviour of source or, when timeout check fails, of an Observable\n *                          passed as a second parameter.\n * @method timeoutWith\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function timeoutWith<T, R>(due: number | Date,\n                                  withObservable: ObservableInput<R>,\n                                  scheduler: SchedulerLike = async): OperatorFunction<T, T | R> {\n  return (source: Observable<T>) => {\n    let absoluteTimeout = isDate(due);\n    let waitFor = absoluteTimeout ?

* Converts a callback API to a function that returns an Observable.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Give it a function `f` of type `f(x, callback)` and\n * it will return a function `g` that when called as `g(x)` will output an\n * Observable.</span>\n *\n * `bindCallback` is not an operator because its input and output are not\n * Observables. The input is a function `func` with some parameters. The\n * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n * done.\n *\n * The output of `bindCallback` is a function that takes the same parameters\n * as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output function\n * is called with arguments it will return an Observable. If function `func`\n * calls its callback with one argument, the Observable will emit that value.\n * If on the other hand the callback is called with multiple values the resulting\n * Observable will emit an array with said values as arguments.\n *\n * It is **very important** to remember that input function `func` is not called\n * when the output function is, but rather when the Observable returned by the output\n * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes an AJAX request, that request\n * will be made every time someone subscribes to the resulting Observable, but not before.\n *\n * The last optional parameter - `scheduler` - can be used to control when the call\n * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n * passed to callback will be emitted. By default, the subscription to an Observable calls `func`\n * synchronously, but using {@link asyncScheduler} as the last parameter will defer the call to `func`,\n * just like wrapping the call in `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0` would. If you were to use the async Scheduler\n * and call `subscribe` on the output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing\n * will end before `func` is invoked.\n *\n * By default, results passed to the callback are emitted immediately after `func` invokes the callback.\n * In particular, if the callback is called synchronously, then the subscription of the resulting Observable\n * will call the `next` function synchronously as well.  If you want to defer that call,\n * you may use {@link asyncScheduler} just as before.  This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can\n * ensure that `func` always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n *\n * Note that the Observable created by the output function will always emit a single value\n * and then complete immediately. If `func` calls the callback multiple times, values from subsequent\n * calls will not appear in the stream. If you need to listen for multiple calls,\n *  you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n *\n * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property) and is not already bound, the context of `func`\n * will be the context that the output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\n * is called as a method of some objec and if `func` is not already bound, in order to preserve the context\n * it is recommended that the context of the output function is set to that object as well.\n *\n * If the input function calls its callback in the \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\n * optional error parameter signaling whether the call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\n * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\n * `bindCallback` will treat such functions the same as any other and error parameters\n * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\n *\n * ## Examples\n *\n * ### Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API\n * ```ts\n * import { bindCallback } from 'rxjs';\n * import * as jQuery from 'jquery';\n *\n * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)\n * const getJSONAsObservable = bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);\n * const result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n * ```\n *\n * ### Receive an array of arguments passed to a callback\n * ```ts\n * import { bindCallback } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const someFunction = (a, b, c) => {\n *   console.log(a); // 5\n *   console.log(b); // 'some string'\n *   console.log(c); // {someProperty: 'someValue'}\n * };\n *\n * const boundSomeFunction = bindCallback(someFunction);\n * boundSomeFunction().subscribe(values => {\n *   console.log(values) // [5, 'some string', {someProperty: 'someValue'}]\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ### Compare behaviour with and without async Scheduler\n * ```ts\n * import { bindCallback } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * function iCallMyCallbackSynchronously(cb) {\n *   cb();\n * }\n *\n * const boundSyncFn = bindCallback(iCallMyCallbackSynchronously);\n * const boundAsyncFn = bindCallback(iCallMyCallbackSynchronously, null, Rx.Scheduler.async);\n *\n * boundSyncFn().subscribe(() => console.log('I was sync!'));\n * boundAsyncFn().subscribe(() => console.log('I was async!'));\n * console.log('This happened...');\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // I was sync!\n * // This happened...\n * // I was async!\n * ```\n *\n * ### Use bindCallback on an object method\n * ```ts\n * import { bindCallback } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const boundMethod = bindCallback(someObject.methodWithCallback);\n * boundMethod.call(someObject) // make sure methodWithCallback has access to someObject\n * .subscribe(subscriber);\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link bindNodeCallback}\n * @see {@link from}\n *\n * @param {function} func A function with a callback as the last parameter.\n * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler] The scheduler on which to schedule the\n * callbacks.\n * @return {function(...params: *): Observable} A function which returns the\n * Observable that delivers the same values the callback would deliver.\n * @name bindCallback\n */\nexport function bindCallback<T>(\n  callbackFunc:

By default call to\n * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed\n * with proper `scheduler` provided as optional third parameter. {@link SchedulerLike}\n * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.\n * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where\n * {@link SchedulerLike} works exactly the same.\n *\n * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context\n * of returned function, when it is called.\n *\n * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means\n * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive\n * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions\n * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or\n * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n *\n * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.\n * \"Node.js-style\" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for\n * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,\n * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.\n *\n * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance\n * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.\n * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as \"present\", when value\n * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty\n * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error\n * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when\n * `bindNodeCallback` is used. If your Observable errors much more often then you\n * would expect, check if callback really is called in Node.js-style and, if not,\n * switch to {@link bindCallback} instead.\n *\n * Note that even if error parameter is technically present in callback, but its value\n * is falsy, it still won't appear in array emitted by Observable.\n *\n * ## Examples\n * ###  Read a file from the filesystem and get the data as an Observable\n * ```ts\n * import * as fs from 'fs';\n * const readFileAsObservable = bindNodeCallback(fs.readFile);\n * const result = readFileAsObservable('./roadNames.txt', 'utf8');\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n * ```\n *\n * ### Use on function calling callback with multiple arguments\n * ```ts\n * someFunction((err, a, b) => {\n *   console.log(err); // null\n *   console.log(a); // 5\n *   console.log(b); // \"some string\"\n * });\n * const boundSomeFunction = bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n * boundSomeFunction()\n * .subscribe(value => {\n *   console.log(value); // [5, \"some string\"]\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ### Use on function calling callback in regular style\n * ```ts\n * someFunction(a => {\n *   console.log(a); // 5\n * });\n * const boundSomeFunction = bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n * boundSomeFunction()\n * .subscribe(\n *   value => {}             // never gets called\n *   err => console.log(err) // 5\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link bindCallback}\n * @see {@link from}\n *\n * @param {function} func Function with a Node.js-style callback as the last parameter.\n * @param

So for example if Node.js library exposes\n * event target which has the same method names as DOM EventTarget, `fromEvent` is still\n * a good choice.\n *\n * If the API you use is more callback then event handler oriented (subscribed\n * callback function fires only once and thus there is no need to manually\n * unregister it), you should use {@link bindCallback} or {@link bindNodeCallback}\n * instead.\n *\n * `fromEvent` supports following types of event targets:\n *\n * **DOM EventTarget**\n *\n * This is an object with `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` methods.\n *\n * In the browser, `addEventListener` accepts - apart from event type string and event\n * handler function arguments - optional third parameter, which is either an object or boolean,\n * both used for additional configuration how and when passed function will be called. When\n * `fromEvent` is used with event target of that type, you can provide this values\n * as third parameter as well.\n *\n * **Node.js EventEmitter**\n *\n * An object with `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.\n *\n * **JQuery-style event target**\n *\n * An object with `on` and `off` methods\n *\n * **DOM NodeList**\n *\n * List of DOM Nodes, returned for example by `document.querySelectorAll` or `Node.childNodes`.\n *\n * Although this collection is not event target in itself, `fromEvent` will iterate over all Nodes\n * it contains and install event handler function in every of them. When returned Observable\n * is unsubscribed, function will be removed from all Nodes.\n *\n * **DOM HtmlCollection**\n *\n * Just as in case of NodeList it is a collection of DOM nodes.

Then it will be passed\n * as a second argument to `removeHandler`, where you will be able to use it.\n *\n * If you need access to all event handler parameters (not only the first one),\n * or you need to transform them in any way, you can call `fromEventPattern` with optional\n * third parameter - project function which will accept all arguments passed to\n * event handler when it is called.

First argument of `generate` is a beginning value. Second argument\n * is a function that accepts this value and tests if some condition still holds. If it does,\n * loop continues, if not, it stops. Third value is a function which takes previously defined\n * value and modifies it in some way on each iteration. Note how these three parameters\n * are direct equivalents of three expressions in regular for loop: first expression\n * initializes some state (for example numeric index), second tests if loop can make next\n * iteration (for example if index is lower than 10) and third states how defined value\n * will be modified on every step (index will be incremented by one).\n *\n * Return value of a `generate` operator is an Observable that on each loop iteration\n * emits a value. First, condition function is ran. If it returned true, Observable\n * emits currently stored value (initial value at the first iteration) and then updates\n * that value with iterate function. If at some point condition returned false, Observable\n * completes at that moment.\n *\n * Optionally you can pass fourth parameter to `generate` - a result selector function which allows you\n * to immediately map value that would normally be emitted by an Observable.\n *\n * If you find three anonymous functions in `generate` call hard to read, you can provide\n * single object to the operator instead. That object has properties: `initialState`,\n * `condition`, `iterate` and `resultSelector`, which should have respective values that you\n * would normally pass to `generate`. `resultSelector` is still optional, but that form\n * of calling `generate` allows you to omit `condition` as well. If you omit it, that means\n * condition always holds, so output Observable will never complete.\n *\n * Both forms of `generate` can optionally accept a scheduler. In case of multi-parameter call,\n * scheduler simply comes as a last argument (no matter if there is resultSelector\n * function or not). In case of single-parameter call, you can provide it as a\n * `scheduler` property on object passed to the operator.

If no single Observable is provided, returned Observable will simply behave the same\n * as the source.\n *\n * `onErrorResumeNext` returns an Observable that starts by subscribing and re-emitting values from the source Observable.\n * When its stream of values ends - no matter if Observable completed or emitted an error - `onErrorResumeNext`\n * will subscribe to the first Observable that was passed as an argument to the method. It will start re-emitting\n * its values as well and - again - when that stream ends, `onErrorResumeNext` will proceed to subscribing yet another\n * Observable in provided series, no matter if previous Observable completed or ended with an error. This will\n * be happening until there is no more Observables left in the series, at which point returned Observable will\n * complete - even if the last subscribed stream ended with an error.\n *\n * `onErrorResumeNext` can be therefore thought of as version of {@link concat} operator, which is more permissive\n * when it comes to the errors emitted by its input Observables. While `concat` subscribes to the next Observable\n * in series only if previous one successfully completed, `onErrorResumeNext` subscribes even if it ended with\n * an error.\n *\n * Note that you do not get any access to errors emitted by the Observables. In particular do not\n * expect these errors to appear in error callback passed to {@link Observable#subscribe}.

Optionally takes a\n * {@link SchedulerLike} for managing timers.\n *\n * ## Examples\n *\n * #### Limit click rate\n *\n * Emit clicks at a rate of at most one click per second\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';\n * import { throttleTime } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * const result = clicks.pipe(throttleTime(1000));\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n * ```\n *\n * #### Double Click\n *\n * The following example only emits clicks which happen within a subsequent\n * delay of 400ms of the previous click. This for example can emulate a double\n * click. It makes use of the `trailing` parameter of the throttle configuration.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEvent, asyncScheduler } from 'rxjs';\n * import { throttleTime, withLatestFrom } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * // defaultThottleConfig = { leading: true, trailing: false }\n * const throttleConfig = {\n *   leading: false,\n *   trailing: true\n * }\n *\n * const click = fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * const doubleClick = click.pipe(\n *   throttleTime(400, asyncScheduler, throttleConfig)\n * );\n *\n * doubleClick.subscribe((throttleValue: Event) => {\n *   console.log(`Double-clicked! Timestamp: ${throttleValue.timeStamp}`);\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * If you enable the `leading` parameter in this example, the output would be the primary click and\n * the double click, but restricts additional clicks within 400ms.\n *\n * @see {@link auditTime}\n * @see {@link debounceTime}\n * @see {@link delay}\n * @see {@link sampleTime}\n * @see {@link throttle}\n *\n * @param {number} duration Time to wait before emitting another value after\n * emitting the last value, measured in milliseconds or the time unit determined\n * internally by the optional `scheduler`.\n * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler=async] The {@link SchedulerLike} to use for\n * managing the timers that handle the throttling.\n * @param {Object} config a configuration object to define `leading` and\n * `trailing` behavior.

All input Observables must\n * emit at least one value before the output Observable will emit a value.\n *\n * ## Example\n * On every click event, emit an array with the latest timer event plus the click event\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEvent, interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { withLatestFrom } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * const timer = interval(1000);\n * const result = clicks.pipe(withLatestFrom(timer));\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link combineLatest}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} other An input Observable to combine with the source\n * Observable. More than one input Observables may be given as argument.\n * @param {Function} [project] Projection function for combining values\n * together. Receives all values in order of the Observables passed, where the\n * first parameter is a value from the source Observable. (e.g.\n * `a.pipe(withLatestFrom(b, c), map(([a1, b1, c1]) => a1 + b1 + c1))`). If this is not\n * passed, arrays will be emitted on the output Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n * @method withLatestFrom\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function withLatestFrom<T, R>(...args: Array<ObservableInput<any> |
