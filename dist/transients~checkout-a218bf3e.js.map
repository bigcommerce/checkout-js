It\n   * might be for example a function that you passed to Observable's constructor, but most of the time it is\n   * a library implementation, which defines what will be emitted by an Observable, and when it be will emitted. This means\n   * that calling `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n   * the thought.\n   *\n   * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n   * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n   * of the following ways.\n   *\n   * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n   * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n   * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n   * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n   * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n   * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, if the `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n   * be left uncaught.\n   *\n   * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n   * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where the first function is equivalent\n   * of a `next` method, the second of an `error` method and the third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n   * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n   * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n   * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n   *\n   * Whichever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n   * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop the work that an Observable does and will clean\n   * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n   * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n   *\n   * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n   * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n   * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable\n   * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a `scheduler`.\n   *\n   * ## Example\n   * ### Subscribe with an Observer\n   * ```ts\n   * import { of } from 'rxjs';\n   *\n   * const sumObserver = {\n   *   sum: 0,\n   *   next(value) {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     this.sum = this.sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   error() {\n   *     // We actually could just remove this method,\n   *     // since we do not really care about errors right now.\n   *   },\n   *   complete() {\n   *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);\n   *   }\n   * };\n   *\n   * of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.\n   *   .subscribe(sumObserver);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Subscribe with functions\n   * ```ts\n   * import { of } from 'rxjs'\n   *\n   * let sum = 0;\n   *\n   * of(1, 2, 3).subscribe(\n   *   value => {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     sum = sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   undefined,\n   *   () => console.log('Sum equals: ' + sum)\n   * );\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Cancel a subscription\n   * ```ts\n   * import { interval } from 'rxjs';\n   *\n   * const subscription = interval(1000).subscribe(\n   *   num => console.log(num),\n   *   undefined,\n   *   () => {\n   *     // Will not be called, even when cancelling subscription.\n   *     console.log('completed!');\n   *   }\n   * );\n   *\n   * setTimeout(() => {\n   *   subscription.unsubscribe();\n   *   console.log('unsubscribed!');\n   * }, 2500);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // 0 after 1s\n   * // 1 after 2s\n   * // \"unsubscribed!\" after 2.5s\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @param {Observer|Function} observerOrNext (optional) Either an observer with methods to be called,\n   *  or the first of three possible handlers, which is the handler for each value emitted from the subscribed\n   *  Observable.\n   * @param {Function} error (optional) A handler for a terminal event resulting from an error.

Observable after the other.</span>\n *\n * ![](concat.png)\n *\n * `concat` joins multiple Observables together, by subscribing to them one at a time and\n * merging their results into the output Observable. You can pass either an array of\n * Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result\n * in Observable that completes immediately.\n *\n * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without\n * changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will\n * subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be\n * repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes,\n * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator\n * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out\n * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,\n * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.\n *\n * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete\n * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed. On the other\n * hand, if some Observable simply completes immediately after it is subscribed, it will be\n * invisible for `concat`, which will just move on to the next Observable.\n *\n * If any Observable in chain errors, instead of passing control to the next Observable,\n * `concat` will error immediately as well. Observables that would be subscribed after\n * the one that emitted error, never will.\n *\n * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values\n * will be \"replayed\" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable\n * as many times as you like. If passing the same Observable to `concat` 1000 times becomes tedious,\n * you can always use {@link repeat}.\n *\n * ## Examples\n * ### Concatenate a timer counting from 0 to 3 with a synchronous sequence from 1 to 10\n * ```ts\n * import { concat, interval, range } from 'rxjs';\n * import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const timer = interval(1000).pipe(take(4));\n * const sequence = range(1, 10);\n * const result = concat(timer, sequence);\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // results in:\n * // 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> 2 -1000ms-> 3 -immediate-> 1 ... 10\n * ```\n *\n * ### Concatenate 3 Observables\n * ```ts\n * import { concat, interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const timer1 = interval(1000).pipe(take(10));\n * const timer2 = interval(2000).pipe(take(6));\n * const timer3 = interval(500).pipe(take(10));\n *\n * const result = concat(timer1, timer2, timer3);\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // results in the following:\n * // (Prints to console sequentially)\n * // -1000ms-> 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> ... 9\n * // -2000ms-> 0 -2000ms-> 1 -2000ms-> ... 5\n * // -500ms-> 0 -500ms-> 1 -500ms-> ... 9\n * ```\n *\n * ### Concatenate the same Observable to repeat it\n * ```ts\n * import { concat, interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const timer = interval(1000).pipe(take(2));\n *\n * concat(timer, timer) // concatenating the same Observable!\n * .subscribe(\n *   value => console.log(value),\n *   err => {},\n *   () => console.log('...and it is done!')\n * );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 0 after 1s\n * // 1 after 2s\n * // 0 after 3s\n * // 1 after 4s\n * // \"...and it is done!\" also after 4s\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link concatAll}\n * @see {@link concatMap}\n * @see {@link concatMapTo}\n * @see {@link startWith}\n * @see {@link endWith}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} input1 An input Observable to concatenate with others.\n * @param {ObservableInput} input2 An input Observable to concatenate with others.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as argument.\n * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler=null] An optional {@link SchedulerLike} to schedule each\n * Observable subscription on.\n * @return {Observable} All values of each passed Observable merged into a\n * single Observable, in order, in serial fashion.\n * @static true\n * @name concat\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function concat<O extends ObservableInput<any>, R>(...observables: Array<O | SchedulerLike>): Observable<ObservedValueOf<O> | R> {\n  return concatAll<R>()(of(...observables));\n}\n","import { isArray } from './isArray';\n\nexport function isNumeric(val: any): val is number | string {\n  // parseFloat NaNs numeric-cast false positives (null|true|false|\"\")\n  // ...but misinterprets leading-number strings, particularly hex literals (\"0x...\")\n  // subtraction forces infinities to NaN\n  // adding 1 corrects loss of precision from parseFloat (#15100)\n  return !isArray(val) && (val - parseFloat(val) + 1) >= 0;\n}\n","import { EmptyError } from '../util/EmptyError';\nimport { Observable } from '../Observable';\nimport { Operator } from '../Operator';\nimport { Subscriber } from '../Subscriber';\nimport { TeardownLogic, MonoTypeOperatorFunction } from '../types';\n\n/**\n * If the source observable completes without emitting a value, it will emit\n * an error.

Combines multiple Observables to create an Observable whose values are\n * calculated from the latest values of each of its input Observables.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Whenever any input Observable emits a value, it\n * computes a formula using the latest values from all the inputs, then emits\n * the output of that formula.</span>\n *\n * ![](combineLatest.png)\n *\n * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as\n * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all these values but the last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, if some Observable does not emit a value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n * ## Examples\n * ### Combine two timer Observables\n * ```ts\n * import { combineLatest, timer } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const firstTimer = timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n * ```\n *\n * ### Combine an array of Observables\n * ```ts\n * import { combineLatest, of } from 'rxjs';\n * import { delay, starWith } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => of(n).pipe(\n *     delay(n * 1000),   // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n *     startWith(0),\n *   )\n * );\n * const combined = combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index\n * ```ts\n * import { combineLatest, of } from 'rxjs';\n * import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const weight = of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n * const height = of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n * const bmi = combineLatest(weight, height).pipe(\n *   map(([w, h]) => w / (h * h)),\n * );\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n *\n * // With output to console:\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link merge}\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler=null] The {@link SchedulerLike} to use for subscribing to\n * each input Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n */\nexport function combineLatest<O extends ObservableInput<any>, R>(\n  ...observables: (O | ((...values: ObservedValueOf<O>[]) => R) | SchedulerLike)[]\n): Observable<R> {\n  let resultSelector: (...values: Array<any>) => R =  null;\n  let scheduler: SchedulerLike = null;\n\n  if (isScheduler(observables[observables.length - 1])) {\n    scheduler = observables.pop() as SchedulerLike;\n  }\n\n  if (typeof observables[observables.length - 1] === 'function') {\n    resultSelector = observables.pop() as (...values: Array<any>) => R;\n  }\n\n  // if the first and only other argument besides the resultSelector is an array\n  // assume it's been called with `combineLatest([obs1, obs2, obs3], resultSelector)`\n  if (observables.length === 1 && isArray(observables[0])) {\n    observables = observables[0] as any;\n  }\n\n  return fromArray(observables, scheduler).lift(new CombineLatestOperator<ObservedValueOf<O>, R>(resultSelector));\n}\n\nexport class CombineLatestOperator<T, R> implements Operator<T, R> {\n  constructor(private resultSelector?: (...values: Array<any>) => R) {\n  }\n\n  call(subscriber: Subscriber<R>, source: any): any {\n    return source.subscribe(new CombineLatestSubscriber(subscriber, this.resultSelector));\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nexport class CombineLatestSubscriber<T, R> extends OuterSubscriber<T, R> {\n  private active: number = 0;\n  private values: any[] = [];\n  private observables: any[] = [];\n  private toRespond: number;\n\n  constructor(destination: Subscriber<R>, private resultSelector?: (...values: Array<any>) => R) {\n    super(destination);\n  }\n\n  protected _next(observable: any) {\n    this.values.push(NONE);\n    this.observables.push(observable);\n  }\n\n  protected _complete() {\n    const observables = this.observables;\n    const len = observables.length;\n    if (len === 0) {\n      this.destination.complete();\n    } else {\n      this.active = len;\n      this.toRespond = len;\n      for (let i = 0;

It continues to behave like this for\n * subsequent inner Observables.\n *\n * ## Example\n * Generate new Observable according to source Observable values\n * ```typescript\n * import { of } from 'rxjs';\n * import { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const switched = of(1, 2, 3).pipe(switchMap((x: number) => of(x, x ** 2, x ** 3)));\n * switched.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n * // outputs\n * // 1\n * // 1\n * // 1\n * // 2\n * // 4\n * // 8\n * // ... and so on\n * ```\n *\n * Rerun an interval Observable on every click event\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEvent, interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * const result = clicks.pipe(switchMap((ev) => interval(1000)));\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link concatMap}\n * @see {@link exhaustMap}\n * @see {@link mergeMap}\n * @see {@link switchAll}\n * @see {@link switchMapTo}\n *\n * @param {function(value: T, ?index: number): ObservableInput} project A function\n * that, when applied to an item emitted by the source Observable, returns an\n * Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits the result of applying the\n * projection function (and the optional deprecated `resultSelector`) to each item\n * emitted by the source Observable and taking only the values from the most recently\n * projected inner Observable.\n * @method switchMap\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function switchMap<T, R, O extends ObservableInput<any>>(\n  project: (value: T, index: number) => O,\n  resultSelector?: (outerValue: T, innerValue: ObservedValueOf<O>, outerIndex: number, innerIndex: number) => R,\n): OperatorFunction<T, ObservedValueOf<O>|R> {\n  if (typeof resultSelector === 'function') {\n    return (source: Observable<T>) => source.pipe(\n      switchMap((a, i) => from(project(a, i)).pipe(\n        map((b, ii) => resultSelector(a, b, i, ii))\n      ))\n    );\n  }\n  return (source: Observable<T>) => source.lift(new SwitchMapOperator(project));\n}\n\nclass SwitchMapOperator<T, R> implements Operator<T, R> {\n  constructor(private project: (value: T, index: number) => ObservableInput<R>) {\n  }\n\n  call(subscriber: Subscriber<R>, source: any): any {\n    return source.subscribe(new SwitchMapSubscriber(subscriber, this.project));\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nclass SwitchMapSubscriber<T, R> extends OuterSubscriber<T, R> {\n  private index: number = 0;\n  private innerSubscription: Subscription;\n\n  constructor(destination: Subscriber<R>,\n              private project: (value: T, index: number) => ObservableInput<R>) {\n    super(destination);\n  }\n\n  protected _next(value: T) {\n    let result: ObservableInput<R>;\n    const index = this.index++;\n    try {\n      result = this.project(value, index);\n    } catch (error) {\n      this.destination.error(error);\n      return;\n    }\n    this._innerSub(result, value, index);\n  }\n\n  private _innerSub(result: ObservableInput<R>, value: T, index: number) {\n    const innerSubscription = this.innerSubscription;\n    if (innerSubscription) {\n      innerSubscription.unsubscribe();\n    }\n    const innerSubscriber = new InnerSubscriber(this, value, index);\n    const destination = this.destination as Subscription;\n    destination.add(innerSubscriber);\n    this.innerSubscription = subscribeToResult(this, result, undefined, undefined, innerSubscriber);\n    // The returned subscription will usually be the subscriber that was\n    // passed.

* Converts a callback API to a function that returns an Observable.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Give it a function `f` of type `f(x, callback)` and\n * it will return a function `g` that when called as `g(x)` will output an\n * Observable.</span>\n *\n * `bindCallback` is not an operator because its input and output are not\n * Observables. The input is a function `func` with some parameters. The\n * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n * done.\n *\n * The output of `bindCallback` is a function that takes the same parameters\n * as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output function\n * is called with arguments it will return an Observable. If function `func`\n * calls its callback with one argument, the Observable will emit that value.\n * If on the other hand the callback is called with multiple values the resulting\n * Observable will emit an array with said values as arguments.\n *\n * It is **very important** to remember that input function `func` is not called\n * when the output function is, but rather when the Observable returned by the output\n * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes an AJAX request, that request\n * will be made every time someone subscribes to the resulting Observable, but not before.\n *\n * The last optional parameter - `scheduler` - can be used to control when the call\n * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n * passed to callback will be emitted. By default, the subscription to an Observable calls `func`\n * synchronously, but using {@link asyncScheduler} as the last parameter will defer the call to `func`,\n * just like wrapping the call in `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0` would. If you were to use the async Scheduler\n * and call `subscribe` on the output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing\n * will end before `func` is invoked.\n *\n * By default, results passed to the callback are emitted immediately after `func` invokes the callback.\n * In particular, if the callback is called synchronously, then the subscription of the resulting Observable\n * will call the `next` function synchronously as well.  If you want to defer that call,\n * you may use {@link asyncScheduler} just as before.  This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can\n * ensure that `func` always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n *\n * Note that the Observable created by the output function will always emit a single value\n * and then complete immediately. If `func` calls the callback multiple times, values from subsequent\n * calls will not appear in the stream. If you need to listen for multiple calls,\n *  you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n *\n * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property) and is not already bound, the context of `func`\n * will be the context that the output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\n * is called as a method of some objec and if `func` is not already bound, in order to preserve the context\n * it is recommended that the context of the output function is set to that object as well.\n *\n * If the input function calls its callback in the \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\n * optional error parameter signaling whether the call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\n * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\n * `bindCallback` will treat such functions the same as any other and error parameters\n * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\n *\n * ## Examples\n *\n * ### Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API\n * ```ts\n * import { bindCallback }

{@link bindCallback}, but the\n * callback is expected to be of type `callback(error, result)`.</span>\n *\n * `bindNodeCallback` is not an operator because its input and output are not\n * Observables. The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the\n * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n * done. The callback function is expected to follow Node.js conventions,\n * where the first argument to the callback is an error object, signaling\n * whether call was successful. If that object is passed to callback, it means\n * something went wrong.\n *\n * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same\n * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output\n * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.\n * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will\n * error with that value as well. If error parameter is not passed, Observable will emit\n * second parameter. If there are more parameters (third and so on),\n * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.\n *\n * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,\n * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to\n * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed\n * with proper `scheduler` provided as optional third parameter. {@link SchedulerLike}\n * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.\n * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where\n * {@link SchedulerLike} works exactly the same.\n *\n * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context\n * of returned function, when it is called.\n *\n * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means\n * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive\n * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions\n * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or\n * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n *\n * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.\n * \"Node.js-style\" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for\n * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,\n * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.\n *\n * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance\n * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.\n * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as \"present\", when value\n * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty\n * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error\n * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when\n * `bindNodeCallback` is used. If your Observable errors much more often then you\n * would expect, check if callback really is called in Node.js-style and, if not,\n * switch to {@link bindCallback} instead.\n *\n * Note that even if error parameter is technically present in callback, but its value\n * is falsy, it still won't appear in array emitted by Observable.\n *\n * ## Examples\n * ###  Read a file from the filesystem and get the data as an Observable\n * ```ts\n * import * as fs from 'fs';\n * const readFileAsObservable = bindNodeCallback(fs.readFile);\n * const result = readFileAsObservable('./roadNames.txt', 'utf8');\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n * ```\n *\n * ### Use on function calling callback with multiple arguments\n * ```ts\n * someFunction((err, a, b) => {\n *   console.log(err); // null\n *   console.log(a); // 5\n *   console.log(b); // \"some string\"\n * });\n * const boundSomeFunction = bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n * boundSomeFunction()\n * .subscribe(value => {\n *   console.log(value); // [5, \"some string\"]\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ### Use on function calling callback in regular style\n * ```ts\n * someFunction(a => {\n *   console.log(a); // 5\n * });\n * const boundSomeFunction = bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n * boundSomeFunction()\n * .subscribe(\n *   value => {}             // never gets called\n *   err => console.log(err) // 5\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link bindCallback}\n * @see {@link from}\n *\n * @param {function} func Function with a Node.js-style callback as the last parameter.\n * @param

Overall, in order for `forkJoin` to emit a value, all observables passed as arguments\n * have to emit something at least once and complete.\n *\n * If any input observable errors at some point, `forkJoin` will error as well and all other observables\n * will be immediately unsubscribed.\n *\n * Optionally `forkJoin` accepts project function, that will be called with values which normally\n * would land in emitted array.

It means that\n * no matter what kind of object you have and no matter what environment you work in,\n * you can safely use `fromEvent` on that object if it exposes described methods (provided\n * of course they behave as was described above). So for example if Node.js library exposes\n * event target which has the same method names as DOM EventTarget, `fromEvent` is still\n * a good choice.\n *\n * If the API you use is more callback then event handler oriented (subscribed\n * callback function fires only once and thus there is no need to manually\n * unregister it), you should use {@link bindCallback} or {@link bindNodeCallback}\n * instead.\n *\n * `fromEvent` supports following types of event targets:\n *\n * **DOM EventTarget**\n *\n * This is an object with `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` methods.\n *\n * In the browser, `addEventListener` accepts - apart from event type string and event\n * handler function arguments - optional third parameter, which is either an object or boolean,\n * both used for additional configuration how and when passed function will be called. When\n * `fromEvent` is used with event target of that type, you can provide this values\n * as third parameter as well.\n *\n * **Node.js EventEmitter**\n *\n * An object with `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.\n *\n * **JQuery-style event target**\n *\n * An object with `on` and `off` methods\n *\n * **DOM NodeList**\n *\n * List of DOM Nodes, returned for example by `document.querySelectorAll` or `Node.childNodes`.\n *\n * Although this collection is not event target in itself, `fromEvent` will iterate over all Nodes\n * it contains and install event handler function in every of them. When returned Observable\n * is unsubscribed, function will be removed from all Nodes.\n *\n * **DOM HtmlCollection**\n *\n * Just as in case of NodeList it is a collection of DOM nodes. Here as well event handler function is\n * installed and removed in each of elements.\n *\n *\n * ## Examples\n * ### Emits clicks happening on the DOM document\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * clicks.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // Results in:\n * // MouseEvent object logged to console every time a click\n * // occurs on the document.\n * ```\n *\n * ### Use addEventListener with capture option\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const clicksInDocument = fromEvent(document, 'click', true); // note optional configuration parameter\n *                                                              // which will be passed to addEventListener\n * const clicksInDiv = fromEvent(someDivInDocument, 'click');\n *\n * clicksInDocument.subscribe(() => console.log('document'));\n * clicksInDiv.subscribe(() => console.log('div'));\n *\n * // By default events bubble UP in DOM tree, so normally\n * // when we would click on div in document\n * // \"div\" would be logged first and then \"document\".\n * // Since we specified optional `capture` option, document\n * // will catch event when it goes DOWN DOM tree, so console\n * // will log \"document\" and then \"div\".\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link bindCallback}\n * @see {@link bindNodeCallback}\n * @see {@link fromEventPattern}\n *\n * @param {FromEventTarget<T>} target The DOM EventTarget, Node.js\n * EventEmitter, JQuery-like event target, NodeList or HTMLCollection to attach the event handler to.\n * @param {string} eventName The event name of interest, being emitted by the\n * `target`.\n * @param {EventListenerOptions} [options] Options to pass through to addEventListener\n * @return {Observable<T>}\n * @name fromEvent\n */\nexport function fromEvent<T>(\n  target: FromEventTarget<T>,\n  eventName: string,\n  options?: EventListenerOptions | ((...args: any[]) => T),\n  resultSelector?: ((...args: any[]) => T)\n): Observable<T> {\n\n  if (isFunction(options)) {\n    // DEPRECATED PATH\n    resultSelector = options;\n    options = undefined;\n  }\n  if (resultSelector) {\n    // DEPRECATED PATH\n    return fromEvent<T>(target, eventName, <EventListenerOptions | undefined>options).pipe(\n      map(args => isArray(args) ?

Then it will be passed\n * as a second argument to `removeHandler`, where you will be able to use it.\n *\n * If you need access to all event handler parameters (not only the first one),\n * or you need to transform them in any way, you can call `fromEventPattern` with optional\n * third parameter - project function which will accept all arguments passed to\n * event handler when it is called. Whatever is returned from project function will appear on\n * resulting stream instead of usual event handlers first argument. This means\n * that default project can be thought of as function that takes its first parameter\n * and ignores the rest.\n *\n * ## Example\n * ### Emits clicks happening on the DOM document\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEventPattern } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * function addClickHandler(handler) {\n *   document.addEventListener('click', handler);\n * }\n *\n * function removeClickHandler(handler) {\n *   document.removeEventListener('click', handler);\n * }\n *\n * const clicks = fromEventPattern(\n *   addClickHandler,\n *   removeClickHandler\n * );\n * clicks.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // Whenever you click anywhere in the browser, DOM MouseEvent\n * // object will be logged.\n * ```\n *\n * ## Example\n * ### Use with API that returns cancellation token\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEventPattern } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const token = someAPI.registerEventHandler(function() {});\n * someAPI.unregisterEventHandler(token); // this APIs cancellation method accepts\n *                                        // not handler itself, but special token.\n *\n * const someAPIObservable = fromEventPattern(\n *   function(handler) { return someAPI.registerEventHandler(handler); }, // Note that we return the token here...\n *   function(handler, token) { someAPI.unregisterEventHandler(token); }  // ...to then use it here.\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * ## Example\n * ### Use with project function\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEventPattern } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * someAPI.registerEventHandler((eventType, eventMessage) => {\n *   console.log(eventType, eventMessage); // Logs \"EVENT_TYPE\" \"EVENT_MESSAGE\" to console.\n * });\n *\n * const someAPIObservable = fromEventPattern(\n *   handler => someAPI.registerEventHandler(handler),\n *   handler => someAPI.unregisterEventHandler(handler)\n *   (eventType, eventMessage) => eventType + \" --- \" + eventMessage // without that function only \"EVENT_TYPE\"\n * );                                                                // would be emitted by the Observable\n *\n * someAPIObservable.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // \"EVENT_TYPE --- EVENT_MESSAGE\"\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link fromEvent}\n * @see {@link bindCallback}\n * @see {@link bindNodeCallback}\n *\n * @param {function(handler: Function): any} addHandler A function that takes\n * a `handler` function as argument and attaches it somehow to the actual\n * source of events.\n * @param {function(handler: Function, token?: any): void} [removeHandler] A function that\n * takes a `handler` function as an argument and removes it from the event source.

First argument of `generate` is a beginning value. Second argument\n * is a function that accepts this value and tests if some condition still holds. If it does,\n * loop continues, if not, it stops. Third value is a function which takes previously defined\n * value and modifies it in some way on each iteration. Note how these three parameters\n * are direct equivalents of three expressions in regular for loop: first expression\n * initializes some state (for example numeric index), second tests if loop can make next\n * iteration (for example if index is lower than 10) and third states how defined value\n * will be modified on every step (index will be incremented by one).\n *\n * Return value of a `generate` operator is an Observable that on each loop iteration\n * emits a value. First, condition function is ran. If it returned true, Observable\n * emits currently stored value (initial value at the first iteration) and then updates\n * that value with iterate function. If at some point condition returned false, Observable\n * completes at that moment.\n *\n * Optionally you can pass fourth parameter to `generate` - a result selector function which allows you\n * to immediately map value that would normally be emitted by an Observable.\n *\n * If you find three anonymous functions in `generate` call hard to read, you can provide\n * single object to the operator instead. That object has properties: `initialState`,\n * `condition`, `iterate` and `resultSelector`, which should have respective values that you\n * would normally pass to `generate`. `resultSelector` is still optional, but that form\n * of calling `generate` allows you to omit `condition` as well. If you omit it, that means\n * condition always holds, so output Observable will never complete.\n *\n * Both forms of `generate` can optionally accept a scheduler. In case of multi-parameter call,\n * scheduler simply comes as a last argument (no matter if there is resultSelector\n * function or not). In case of single-parameter call, you can provide it as a\n * `scheduler` property on object passed to the operator. In both cases scheduler decides when\n * next iteration of the loop will happen and therefore when next value will be emitted\n * by the Observable. For example to ensure that each value is pushed to the observer\n * on separate task in event loop, you could use `async` scheduler. Note that\n * by default (when no scheduler is passed) values are simply emitted synchronously.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use with condition and iterate functions.</caption>\n * const generated = generate(0, x => x < 3, x => x + 1);\n *\n * generated.subscribe(\n *   value => console.log(value),\n *   err => {},\n *   () => console.log('Yo!')\n * );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 0\n * // 1\n * // 2\n * // \"Yo!\"\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use with condition, iterate and resultSelector functions.</caption>\n * const generated = generate(0, x => x < 3, x => x + 1, x => x * 1000);\n *\n * generated.subscribe(\n *   value => console.log(value),\n *   err => {},\n *   () => console.log('Yo!')\n * );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 0\n * // 1000\n * // 2000\n * // \"Yo!\"\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use with options object.</caption>\n * const generated = generate({\n *   initialState: 0,\n *   condition(value) { return value < 3; },\n *   iterate(value) { return value + 1; },\n *   resultSelector(value) { return value * 1000; }\n * });\n *\n * generated.subscribe(\n *   value => console.log(value),\n *   err => {},\n *   () => console.log('Yo!')\n * );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 0\n * // 1000\n * // 2000\n * // \"Yo!\"\n *\n * @example <caption>Use options object without condition function.</caption>\n * const generated = generate({\n *   initialState: 0,\n *   iterate(value) { return value + 1; },\n *   resultSelector(value) { return value * 1000; }\n * });\n *\n * generated.subscribe(\n *   value => console.log(value),\n *   err => {},\n *   () => console.log('Yo!') // This will never run.\n * );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 0\n * // 1000\n * // 2000\n * // 3000\n * // ...and never stops.\n *\n *\n * @see {@link from}\n * @see {@link index/Observable.create}\n *\n * @param {S} initialState Initial state.\n * @param {function (state: S): boolean} condition Condition to terminate generation (upon returning false).\n * @param {function (state: S): S} iterate Iteration step function.\n * @param {function (state: S): T} [resultSelector] Selector function for results produced in the sequence.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler] A {@link Scheduler} on which to run the generator loop.

If no single Observable is provided, returned Observable will simply behave the same\n * as the source.\n *\n * `onErrorResumeNext` returns an Observable that starts by subscribing and re-emitting values from the source Observable.\n * When its stream of values ends - no matter if Observable completed or emitted an error - `onErrorResumeNext`\n * will subscribe to the first Observable that was passed as an argument to the method. It will start re-emitting\n * its values as well and - again - when that stream ends, `onErrorResumeNext` will proceed to subscribing yet another\n * Observable in provided series, no matter if previous Observable completed or ended with an error. This will\n * be happening until there is no more Observables left in the series, at which point returned Observable will\n * complete - even if the last subscribed stream ended with an error.\n *\n * `onErrorResumeNext` can be therefore thought of as version of {@link concat} operator, which is more permissive\n * when it comes to the errors emitted by its input Observables. While `concat` subscribes to the next Observable\n * in series only if previous one successfully completed, `onErrorResumeNext` subscribes even if it ended with\n * an error.\n *\n * Note that you do not get any access to errors emitted by the Observables. In particular do not\n * expect these errors to appear in error callback passed to {@link Observable#subscribe}.

Optionally takes a\n * {@link SchedulerLike} for managing timers.\n *\n * ## Examples\n *\n * #### Limit click rate\n *\n * Emit clicks at a rate of at most one click per second\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';\n * import { throttleTime } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * const result = clicks.pipe(throttleTime(1000));\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n * ```\n *\n * #### Double Click\n *\n * The following example only emits clicks which happen within a subsequent\n * delay of 400ms of the previous click. This for example can emulate a double\n * click. It makes use of the `trailing` parameter of the throttle configuration.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEvent, asyncScheduler } from 'rxjs';\n * import { throttleTime, withLatestFrom } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * // defaultThottleConfig = { leading: true, trailing: false }\n * const throttleConfig = {\n *   leading: false,\n *   trailing: true\n * }\n *\n * const click = fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * const doubleClick = click.pipe(\n *   throttleTime(400, asyncScheduler, throttleConfig)\n * );\n *\n * doubleClick.subscribe((throttleValue: Event) => {\n *   console.log(`Double-clicked! Timestamp: ${throttleValue.timeStamp}`);\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * If you enable the `leading` parameter in this example, the output would be the primary click and\n * the double click, but restricts additional clicks within 400ms.\n *\n * @see {@link auditTime}\n * @see {@link debounceTime}\n * @see {@link delay}\n * @see {@link sampleTime}\n * @see {@link throttle}\n *\n * @param {number} duration Time to wait before emitting another value after\n * emitting the last value, measured in milliseconds or the time unit determined\n * internally by the optional `scheduler`.\n * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler=async] The {@link SchedulerLike} to use for\n * managing the timers that handle the throttling.\n * @param {Object} config a configuration object to define `leading` and\n * `trailing` behavior.

All input Observables must\n * emit at least one value before the output Observable will emit a value.\n *\n * ## Example\n * On every click event, emit an array with the latest timer event plus the click event\n * ```ts\n * import { fromEvent, interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { withLatestFrom } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * const timer = interval(1000);\n * const result = clicks.pipe(withLatestFrom(timer));\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link combineLatest}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} other An input Observable to combine with the source\n * Observable. More than one input Observables may be given as argument.\n * @param {Function} [project] Projection function for combining values\n * together. Receives all values in order of the Observables passed, where the\n * first parameter is a value from the source Observable. (e.g.\n * `a.pipe(withLatestFrom(b, c), map(([a1, b1, c1]) => a1 + b1 + c1))`). If this is not\n * passed, arrays will be emitted on the output Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n * @method withLatestFrom\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function withLatestFrom<T, R>(...args: Array<ObservableInput<any> |
